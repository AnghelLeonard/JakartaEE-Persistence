This application is an example of caching query results via `eclipselink.cache-usage` hint. This is useful for caching the results of the commonly used queries. For checking the cache, and afterwards the database, set this hint to `CheckCacheThenDatabase`. If you want to check only the cache then set it to `CheckCacheOnly`.
